## About Me:

My name is Yevhen, I am Ukrainian, from Kyiv. I am fifty three, yes, right. I am fifty three. I am sure that you gonna be surprised that I want to study IT profession at my fifty three. But actually, I believe that age is nothing more than just a number.

In the last time I thought about learning IT profession. And almost all the time I heart that it is difficult and I am old for it. But I am totally sure that it is not true and it is not about me.

IT allows people to take their careers in a number of different directions. It is not only about working remotely and earning a lot of money, for me it is a chance, it is my dream to prove that nothing is impossible, even to get a new profession at fifty three. Why not?
